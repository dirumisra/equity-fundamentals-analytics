# Equity Fundamentals Analytics

This project implements an end-to-end analytics pipeline for equity fundamentals data.  
It processes raw financial data, cleans and standardizes it, computes derived financial metrics,  
applies screening and ranking logic, and runs in configurable Dev/UAT/Prod-like environments.
